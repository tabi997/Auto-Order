# Admin Navigation Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of admin navigation functionality and the refactoring of authentication logic in the AutoOrder application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Context (`src/lib/auth-context.tsx`)
- Created a new client-side authentication context using React Context API
- Manages user state, admin role, and loading states
- Provides real-time authentication state updates
- Includes signOut functionality

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Hooks (`src/lib/hooks/useUserRole.ts`)
- Created a specialized hook for checking user roles
- Provides utility functions for role-based access control
- Includes `hasRole()`, `hasAnyRole()`, and specific role checks
- Returns authentication state and user information

### 3. Refactored Authentication Logic (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks
- Removed verbose console logging for production
- Added utility functions: `hasAdminRole()` and `hasRole()`
- Better error handling and redirects

### 4. Enhanced Client Authentication (`src/lib/auth-client.ts`)
- Improved error handling for client-side operations
- Added role checking utility functions
- Better error logging and fallback behavior

### 5. Admin Button Component (`src/components/AdminButton.tsx`)
- Reusable admin button component
- Supports different variants, sizes, and mobile layouts
- Automatically hides when user is not admin
- Consistent styling with purple theme

### 6. Updated Navigation (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`)
- Integrated admin button in both desktop and mobile navigation
- Uses the new AdminButton component for consistency
- Admin button only appears for authenticated admin users

### 7. Root Layout Integration (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Wrapped the entire application with AuthProvider
- Ensures authentication state is available throughout the app

## Features

### Admin Button Visibility
- **Desktop**: Appears in the top-right action buttons area
- **Mobile**: Appears in the mobile navigation menu
- **Conditional**: Only visible when user has admin role
- **Styling**: Purple theme to distinguish from other buttons

### Authentication State Management
- Real-time updates when authentication state changes
- Automatic role checking and validation
- Loading states to prevent UI flicker
- Secure role-based access control

### Role-Based Access Control
- `isAdmin`: Check if user has admin role
- `isStaff`: Check if user has staff role  
- `isUser`: Check if user has basic user role
- `hasRole(role)`: Check for specific role
- `hasAnyRole(roles[])`: Check if user has any of the specified roles

## Usage Examples

### Using the Admin Button Component
```tsx
// Basic usage
<AdminButton />

// Custom styling
<AdminButton variant="default" size="lg" className="custom-class" />

// Mobile layout
<AdminButton mobile />

// Without text (icon only)
<AdminButton showText={false} />
```

### Using the useUserRole Hook
```tsx
const { isAdmin, isStaff, hasRole, isLoading } = useUserRole()

if (isAdmin) {
  // Show admin features
}

if (hasRole('staff')) {
  // Show staff features
}
```

### Using the Auth Context
```tsx
const { user, isAdmin, signOut } = useAuth()

// Check authentication
if (user) {
  // User is logged in
}

// Sign out
await signOut()
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Server-Side Validation**: All admin routes are protected by server-side middleware
2. **Role Verification**: Admin status is verified on both client and server
3. **Session Management**: Secure session handling with Supabase
4. **Route Protection**: Admin routes redirect unauthorized users

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Context Optimization**: Authentication state is shared across components
2. **Conditional Rendering**: Admin button only renders when needed
3. **Efficient Updates**: Real-time auth state updates without unnecessary re-renders
4. **Lazy Loading**: Authentication context loads only when needed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Role Hierarchy**: Support for role inheritance and permissions
2. **Audit Logging**: Track admin actions and role changes
3. **Multi-Tenant Support**: Support for different admin levels
4. **Permission System**: Granular permissions for different admin functions

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Logging in as an admin user
2. Verifying the admin button appears in navigation
3. Testing mobile responsiveness
4. Verifying button disappears for non-admin users
5. Testing authentication state changes

## Dependencies

- React Context API
- Supabase authentication
- Lucide React icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling
