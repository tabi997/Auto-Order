# FloatingContactButton Component Refactor

## Overview
The `FloatingContactButton` component has been completely refactored to improve accessibility, performance, user experience, and code quality. This document outlines all the improvements made.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Accessibility Issues
- **Before**: Missing proper ARIA attributes, inaccessible tooltip, no screen reader support
- **After**: 
  - Added proper `role="complementary"` and `aria-label` attributes
  - Enhanced tooltip with `role="tooltip"` and proper positioning
  - Added keyboard navigation support (Enter, Space keys)
  - Improved notification indicator with meaningful `aria-label`
  - Added focus management with visible focus rings

### 2. Performance Issues
- **Before**: State updates on every mouse enter/leave, unnecessary re-renders
- **After**:
  - Implemented `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent excessive re-renders
  - Created custom `useScrollVisibility` hook with optimized scroll handling
  - Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth scroll performance
  - Added passive scroll listeners for better performance

### 3. UX Issues
- **Before**: Tooltip could be cut off, distracting animation, no mobile consideration
- **After**:
  - Smart scroll-based visibility (hides on scroll down, shows on scroll up)
  - Responsive tooltip positioning that adapts to screen size
  - Less distracting notification animation (`animate-ping` instead of `animate-pulse`)
  - Mobile-friendly alternative text display
  - Better touch event handling for mobile devices

### 4. Code Quality
- **Before**: Mixed styling approaches, hardcoded colors, missing TypeScript interfaces
- **After**:
  - Extracted custom hook for better separation of concerns
  - Used design system colors (`bg-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`)
  - Consistent Tailwind CSS classes with responsive variants
  - Better component structure and organization
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments

### 5. Responsiveness
- **Before**: Fixed positioning that didn't work well on all screen sizes
- **After**:
  - Responsive sizing (`h-14 w-14 sm:h-16 sm:w-16`)
  - Adaptive positioning for different screen sizes
  - Landscape orientation support for mobile devices
  - Mobile-optimized touch interactions

## New Features Added

### 1. Scroll-Based Visibility
- Button automatically hides when scrolling down (past 100px threshold)
- Reappears when scrolling up
- Smooth transitions with `requestAnimationFrame` optimization

### 2. Enhanced Mobile Experience
- Touch event handling with proper timing
- Landscape orientation support
- Mobile-specific alternative text display
- Responsive sizing and positioning

### 3. Accessibility Enhancements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Reduced motion support for users with motion sensitivity

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Debounced hover state updates
- Optimized scroll event handling
- Passive event listeners
- Memoized callback functions

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Custom Hook: `useScrollVisibility`
```typescript
export function useScrollVisibility(threshold = 100): boolean
```
- Handles scroll-based visibility logic
- Optimized with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Client-side only execution
- Configurable threshold

### 2. Enhanced Event Handling
- `useCallback` for all event handlers
- Touch event support for mobile
- Keyboard event handling
- Proper cleanup and memory management

### 3. Responsive Design System
- Mobile-first approach with `sm:` breakpoints
- Landscape orientation handling
- Adaptive sizing and positioning
- Mobile-optimized interactions

### 4. Accessibility Features
- ARIA roles and labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Screen reader support
- Reduced motion preferences

## CSS Classes Used

### Responsive Design
- `h-14 w-14 sm:h-16 sm:w-16` - Adaptive sizing
- `bottom-4 right-4 sm:bottom-6 sm:right-6` - Responsive positioning

### Accessibility
- `focus:ring-4 focus:ring-primary/20` - Focus indicators
- `focus:outline-none` - Custom focus styling
